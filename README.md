TODO: One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Ruby

Ruby should come pre-installed on all OSX computers. You can check if Ruby is installed by running ruby -v. It should return with Ruby version 2.0.0 or higher. If for some reason you're running a lower version, you can update

```
sudo gem install ruby
```

#### Bundler

Bundler is a package manager that will aid you in installing all the Jekyll dependencies.

```
sudo gem install bundler jekyll
```

### Installing

Confirm that you have a GEMFILE containing the following.

```
gem 'github-pages'
source 'https://rubygems.org'
```

Then run the bundle installer.

```
bundle install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the app locally

```
cd web
jekyll serve
```

The site runs on [port 4000](http://localhost:4000/_pages/doc/nda/index.html).
