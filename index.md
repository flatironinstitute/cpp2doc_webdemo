## Getting started

### Dependencies

Jek Theme TRIQS is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Jek Theme TRIQS requires no special plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

TRIQS is composed of libraries in two languages: 1. Python libraries implement the most common many-body objects, like Greenâ€™s functions, in user-friendly scripts. 2. C++ libraries enable users to quickly develop high-performance low-level codes

This duality is a real advantage in the development of new many-body tools. Critical parts where performance is essential can be written in C++ (e.g. a quantum impurity solver) while data analysis, preparation of inputs or interface with other programs can be handled in more user-friendly Python scripts.

### Quick start: Code in the browser

Access TRIQS remotely via [Binder](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

```yaml
remote_theme: lizlove/jek-theme-triqs
```

<small>You must have GitHub Pages enabled on your repo, one or more Markdown files, and a `_config.yml` file. [See an example repository](https://github.com/triqs/triqs)</small>

### Local installation: Use a package installer

#### Install with Ubuntu

#### Install in a Docker container

```yaml
blah blah
```

#### Install in a Singularity Container

1. Step one of Singularity installation

```bash
$ bundle something fun together.
```

2. Run you local Jekyll server

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.

### Compile from Source
