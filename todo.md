- Review concept page when written.

## Verify:

- Add function name etc on top of each page in heading.(see cppref - only name no namespace with parent/::)
- Multi-column layout build - see /cpp-api/nda - make a 3 col layout top aligned \*\*\* DO FIRST #️⃣1️⃣
- Are the under items individual links or examples? Would the card point to a separate page or to nothing?
