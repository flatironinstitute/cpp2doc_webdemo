# Basic C++ libraries
{: .no_toc }


In this section, we group several small standalone basic C++ libraries.

* They are small basic components on which the TRIQS library and applications are built. 
  <BR>  They are maintained by the TRIQS team.

* They can however be **installed and used independently of TRIQS library and applications**.

* They are released under the Apache2 License (while TRIQS is GPL).
