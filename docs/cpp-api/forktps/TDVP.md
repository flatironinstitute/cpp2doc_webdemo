# Parameters of the function. Edit only the description after the :
params:
  psi: ForkTPS                 State to be time evolved.
  Heff: ForkLocalOp                 Represents the Hamiltonian in the form of effective Hamiltonians needed for the local time evolution steps.
  dt: "template, either double or Complex                 Time step. Real *dt* means imaginary time evolution, and Complex *dt* real time evolution. Note the minus sign in the exponential: If *dt* is positive, the time evolution is perform in forward direction i.e.: $e^{-Hdt}$"
