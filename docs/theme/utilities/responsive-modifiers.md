# Responsive modifiers

Jek Theme TRIQS spacing works in conjunction with a variety of modifiers that allow you to target specific screen sizes responsively. Use these in conjunction with spacing and display prefix and suffix classes.

| Modifier  | Screen size                          |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------|

| `xs`      | 320px (20rem) and up                 |
